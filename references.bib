  abstract     = {The visualization tool offers a nuanced understanding of regression dynamics, going beyond traditional per-unit interpretation of continuous variables versus categorical ones. It highlights the impact of unit changes as well as larger shifts like interquartile changes, acknowledging the distribution of empirical data. Furthermore, it generates visualizations depicting alterations in Odds Ratios for predictors across minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values, aiding in comprehending predictor-outcome interplay within empirical data distributions, particularly in logistic regression frameworks.},
